        <p class="second">Elon Musk is 
            one of my favorite heroes because he is smart 
            and works hard. <span class="sixth">He was born in South Africa 
            but came to the US as a student.</span>
            He knew that one of the ways to stand out 
            as a student is to work on projects. 
            He worked with his brother, 
            who was also in the US, to start a company.</p>
