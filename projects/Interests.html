        <p>Football is a game that is developed in the middle
            ages, a rough form of football emerged in England, where villages would
            compete in mass, chaotic games with goals miles apart. These games, known
            as "mob football", were violent and had very few rules. By the 19th Century,
            it became popular in schools but had different rules and varied from one 
            place to another. 
            In 1863, a football federation was formed in England to standardize the game
            and created a set of first official rules for modern football.
