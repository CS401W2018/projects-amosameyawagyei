        <h2 >Description of the Cape Coast Castle-Ghana</h2>

        <p>Cape Coast Castle is a historic fort located in Cape Coast, Ghana. Built by the Swedish in 1653 and later controlled by the British, it was one of the largest trading posts during the transatlantic slave trade. The castle served as a key point where enslaved Africans were held in dungeons before being shipped across the Atlantic to the Americas. Today, Cape Coast Castle stands as a poignant symbol of this dark history, attracting visitors from around the world. It has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site and now functions as a museum, offering tours that reflect on Ghana's colonial past and the atrocities of slavery.</p>
