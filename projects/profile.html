    <h1>Prison Break</h1>
    <p>I have watched a lot of TV series but Prison Break 
        The name of the main actors are Michael Scottfielld, Lincoln Burrows, Sara Tancredi and <abbr title="T.bag">T.Bag</abbr>
        The first season came out in the year 2009. In the Movie, Lincoln Burrows, the brother of Michael was imprisoned and 
        sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit. Michael, who is an architect by profession, tattoos the blue-print of 
        the prison and gets himsself. A couple more episodes reveal how Michael escaped from the prison with his brother.

    <p>Apart from being an actor doing his job, Wentworth Miller, known as Michael Scottfielld is 
        known to be an intelligent person who pays close attention to details. These are some of his favorite quotes:
    </p>
    <blockquote>&quot;Confidence is at the root of so many attractive qualities - a sense of humor, a sense of style,
         a willingness to be who you are no matter what anyone else might think or say.&quot;</blockquote>
    <blockquote>&quot;You only cry for help if you believe there is help to cry for.&quot;</blockquote>
    <blockquote>&quot;You have to love what you do, and you have to need it like you need air.&quot;</blockquote>
     <blockquote>&quot;My experience is that I find myself having to constantly define myself to others, day-in, day-out. The quote that's helped me the most through that is from <em>Toni Morrison's 'Beloved'</em> where she says,<strong>'Definitions belong to the definers, not the defined'</strong>
     - so I find myself defining myself for other people lest I be defined by others and stuck into some box where I don't particularly belong"&quot;</blockquote>
